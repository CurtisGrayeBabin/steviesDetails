                "It's recommended to get your car clayed several times throughout the year to help remove bonded contaminants from your paint. Allowing the vehicle's surface to be smooth and also allowing the sealant to have a proper bond with the paint, but most importantly will remove harsh contamination that deteriorates your paint over time. With the ceramic sealant, you get an extremely hydrophobic surface while leaving your paint looking glossier than ever."
